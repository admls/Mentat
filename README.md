# Mentat

This wiki is home to a collection of UI/UX plugins for TiddlyWiki. They're suited to larger screens at this point, though they may get adapted for mobile at some point in the not-so-distant future:

    Repopup
        A quick hack of a plugin that attempts to reposition tiddlywiki popups so that they don't run off the screen. It's not perfect and it doesn't seem to do much to normal dropdowns. But it's an okay fix until the popup mechanism can get a comprehensive overhaul. This plugin has been designed with the Volant, Engine, and Mentat Plugins in mind. So if you use it for something else, your mileage may vary.
    Volant
        A plugin to give your tiddlers wings. The default functionality allows tiddlers appropriately tagged with $:/Volant or $:/VolantAbsolute to be dragged and resized. Volant makes use of Repopup to keep popups that emerge from volant tiddlers from running off-screen.
    Engine
        A plugin that builds off of Repopup and Volant to provide a customizable console: a sort of HUD display made out of tiddlers that you can swap in or out and reposition to your heart's content. Have the tools and tiddlers you need, when and where you need them.

    Mentat
        A plugin built on the backs of Repopup, Volant, Engine; providing a fully customizable workspace built out of tiddlers that can be reshaped, placed, replaced, archived, and restored. Something between a desktop and an intrawiki browser; it's quick and intuitive to use, and the basic building block is the tiddler.
