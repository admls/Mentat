* Won't navigate to $:/Windowbar from Engine Button. It opens and closes but doesn't recieve navigation
* Demo needs fixing
* Volant startup-actions will delete the configTiddlers of tiddlers that haven't been named yet (e.g., "New Tiddler (x)").
* Set-default and set-maximize don't work until they're saved, which suggests a filter problem? The volant widget is not getting transcluded in until they enter draft mode.
