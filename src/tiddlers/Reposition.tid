Drag me around by the narrow margin of my border!

If the margin is too narrow to get a good grip, enable Easy-Drag Mode by clicking {{$:/plugins/admls/volant/ui/Buttons/easy-drag}}.

You can find the same button in the Page Controls on the ~SideBar.

With Easy-Drag enabled, you won't be able to select text or the like. Click the same button again to turn it off.
