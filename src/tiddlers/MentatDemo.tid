!!Mentat Storyview

I recommend you have the Engine Button engaged for this. Open $:/Topbar and [[$:/Windowbar]]. Maybe go fullscreen too.

You see the button in the $:/Windowbar (that's the one on the bottom of your screen) that says "~$:/Window 1"?

Change the storyview to "mentat". Open "~$:/Window 1" when you get to the other side.
