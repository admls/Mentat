There's little enough to Engine. You can configure settings here: [[$:/plugins/admls/engine/config/options]].

Restyle the default engine button with css. To replace the default engine button with one of your preference, tag a tiddler with [[$:/tags/EngineButtonTemplate]]. After doing that, it may become necessary to adjust where the engine button menu appears so that it is accessible when you hover over the Engine Button.
