A plugin built on the backs of [[Repopup|$:/plugins/admls/repopup]], [[Volant|$:/plugins/admls/volant]], [[Engine|$:/plugins/admls/engine]]; providing a fully customizable workspace built out of tiddlers that can be reshaped, placed, replaced, archived, and restored. Something between a desktop and an intrawiki browser; it's quick and intuitive to use, and the basic building block is the tiddler.
