A plugin to give your tiddlers wings. The default functionality allows tiddlers appropriately tagged with $:/Volant or $:/VolantAbsolute to be dragged and resized. [[Volant|$:/plugins/admls/volant]] makes use of [[Repopup|$:/plugins/admls/repopup]] to keep popups that emerge from volant tiddlers from running off-screen.
